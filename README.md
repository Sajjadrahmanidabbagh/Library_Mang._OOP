# Library_Mang._OOP

This code was initially developed as a preliminary project for the university library, which was later developed to include more functionalities.

The Library Management System is a Python-based command-line application designed to enhance the efficiency of library operations. By leveraging object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, the system provides a structured and organized approach to managing essential library activities, such as cataloging books, registering users, and overseeing borrowing and returning processes. Its architecture revolves around three core classes—Book, User, and Admin—that encapsulate the attributes and functionalities needed to ensure seamless library management. Through its intuitive design and user-friendly interface, the system simplifies traditionally complex administrative tasks, enabling library staff to maintain accurate records and streamline their workflows.

Key features of the system include the ability to add and manage books, search for titles using name prefixes, and register new users with unique identifiers. The Admin class serves as the central component, offering functionalities for managing the library's inventory, user base, and borrowing records. Users can interact with the system through a straightforward menu-driven interface, which provides options for common operations, such as displaying the catalog, issuing books, and tracking borrowed titles. This modular and accessible design not only improves operational efficiency but also ensures that the system can adapt to the diverse needs of modern libraries.
